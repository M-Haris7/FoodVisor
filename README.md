# FoodVisor
A food calorie estimation system that recognises various food items and estimates calories present in it.

## Dataset
This is the Food 101 dataset, also available from https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/

It contains images of food, organized by type of food. It was used in the Paper "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. It's a good (large dataset) for testing computer vision techniques.

## ML model used
ResNet 50: ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that belongs to the ResNet (Residual Network) family. The ResNet architecture is known for introducing residual connections, which help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and allow the training of very deep neural networks. ResNet-50 specifically has 50 layers.
